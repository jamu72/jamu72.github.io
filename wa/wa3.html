    <p>Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds from the order Sphenisciformes (/sfɪˈnɪsəfɔːrmiːz/) of the family 
        Spheniscidae (/sfɪˈnɪsɪdiː, -daɪ/).[4] They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one species, 
        the Galápagos penguin, is found north of the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the ocean water, penguins have 
        countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other 
        forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow whole while swimming. A penguin has a spiny tongue 
        and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.[5]
        <br>
        They spend about half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea. The largest living species is the emperor 
        penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri):[6] on average, adults are about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb). The 
        smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (Eudyptula minor), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands 
        around 30–33 cm (12–13 in) tall and weighs 1.2–1.3 kg (2.6–2.9 lb).[7] Today, larger penguins generally inhabit colder 
        regions, and smaller penguins inhabit regions with temperate or tropical climates. Some prehistoric penguin species 
        were enormous: as tall or heavy as an adult human. There was a great diversity of species in subantarctic regions, and 
        at least one giant species in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya, during the Late Eocene, a climate 
        decidedly warmer than today.[8]

        The number of extant penguin species is debated. Depending on which authority is followed, penguin biodiversity 
        varies between 17 and 20 living species, all in the subfamily Spheniscinae. Some sources consider the white-flippered 
        penguin a separate Eudyptula species, while others treat it as a subspecies of the little blue penguin;[22][23] the 
        actual situation seems to be more complicated.[24] Similarly, it is still unclear whether the royal penguin is a 
        separate species or merely a color morph of the macaroni penguin. The status of the rockhopper penguins is also unclear.

    <h3 id="Evolution">Evolution</h3>
    <p>The evolutionary history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary biogeography. 
        Although penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the alpha taxonomy 
        of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. Some seminal articles about penguin prehistory have been 
        published since 2005;[3][33][34][35] the evolution of the living genera can be considered resolved by now.

        The basal penguins lived around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event somewhere in the general 
        area of (southern) New Zealand and Byrd Land, Antarctica.[3] Due to plate tectonics, these areas were at that time 
        less than 1,500 kilometres (930 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometres (2,500 mi) of today. The most recent common 
        ancestor of penguins and their sister clade can be roughly dated to the Campanian–Maastrichtian boundary, around 70–68 mya.
        [33][35][36] What can be said as certainly as possible in the absence of direct (i.e., fossil) evidence is that, by the end 
        of the Cretaceous, the penguin lineage must have been evolutionarily well distinct, though much less so morphologically.

        Penguins are superbly adapted to aquatic life. Their wings have evolved to become flippers, useless for flight in the air. 
        In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Penguins' swimming looks very similar to birds' flight in the air.
        [49] Within the smooth plumage a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds 
        in cold waters. On land, penguins use their tails and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.
    </p>
    <p>    
        All penguins are countershaded for camouflage – that is, they have black backs and wings with white fronts.[50] A predator 
        looking up from below (such as an orca or a leopard seal) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the 
        reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gentoo penguins are the fastest underwater birds in the world. They are capable of reaching speeds up to 36 km (about 22 miles) 
        per hour while searching for food or escaping from predators. They are also able to dive to depths of 170–200 meters (about 560–660 
        feet).[51] The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one 
        or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Emperor penguins are the world's deepest-diving birds. They can dive 
        to depths of approximately 550 meters (1,800 feet) while searching for food.[52]
    </p>
    <p>
        Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow while using their feet to propel and steer themselves, 
        a movement called "tobogganing", which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to 
        move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.
